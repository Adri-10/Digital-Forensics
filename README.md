# Digital-Forensics
Digital forensics is the process of collecting, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence for legal or investigative purposes. It is used in civil, criminal and administrative cases to uncover and interpret data from devices like computers, smartphones and storage media.
The main goals of digital forensics are to preserve evidence, recover lost or deleted data, and 
analyze it to identify the facts.  Digital forensics helps investigate cybercrimes, data breaches and 
fraud. It also assists in identifying security flaws and protecting sensitive information. By 
combining technology and investigation, digital forensics plays a key role in solving modern-day 
crimes. 
Tools such as EnCase, FTK (Forensic Toolkit) and Autopsy are commonly used to examine 
digital evidence and ensure its integrity. Here, I used some tools including: StegoMagic, 
HexWorkshop, lostmypass, EaseUS, IUWEshare.
